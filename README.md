# CSC390 - Programming Languages

## Catalog Description
Properties of algorithmic languages including scopes of declarations,
storage allocation, grouping of statements, runtime behavior; introduction
to Language and BNF Grammars. (3 Credit Hours)


## Prerequisite
CS 300 with minimum grade of C


## Course Description
An introduction ot the study of programming languages including the
imperative, object-oriented, logic-oriented, and functional paradigms.
Introduction to formal languages.


## Course Learning Outcomes
1. Students, working in small groups, will learn the basics of
   programming languages new to them.

2. Students will compare and contrast programming languages based on
   programming language principles.

3. Students will write programs in a language of historical importance, 
   and will write programs in at least one language which is quite
   unlike the programming languages they have previously used.


## Expectation of Students
Students are expected to apply what they learn to the study of new
programming languages.  Students are expected to display knowledge of
and programming proficiency in at least two new languages which are
studied as part of the course. Students are expected to works in small
groups to learn other programming languages.
