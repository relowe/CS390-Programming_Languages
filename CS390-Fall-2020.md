# Fall 2020 Scheduling Considerations
## Scheduling Updates
Please note that due to the revised Fall 2020 schedule, our class will meet on
labor day (September 7) and on October 9.

## The Week After Thanksgiving
Classes continue November 30 - December 4 via remote/online instruction.
During this week, we will have one pre-recorded lecture followed by two days of
class presentations via Zoom.  Attendance on these days is mandatory in order
to receive full credit for the group presentation.  I will continue to hold
virtual office hours to answer any of your questions, and to help you prepare
for the final exam.

## Final Exam Schedule
Finals for this semester will be remote or online.  Our final exam will be
given via Canvas, and is formatted as a "take-home" exam.  The exam will be
made available at midnight on the 9th of December, and you will have until
midnight on the 10th of December to complete the exam.  I will be available for
questions reguarding clarification during our scheduled exam period on December
9th, and also during my normal office hour.


# Additional Information
## Professor Availability
I am usually on campus Monday thru Friday from 8:00 AM -- 6:00 PM.  My office
hours are listed above, but I am available other times by appointment.

## Email Responses
I will try to answer emails received during normal business hours on the day I
receive them.  If there is a backlog, you should expect a response by the next
business day. I may respond during weekends, but generally email received over
the weekend will be answered on Monday.

## Course Website
All courses at Southeast Missouri State University will be hosted on Canvas
beginning Spring 2021.  Some courses have made this transition for Fall 2020,
and we are one of these pilot courses for Canvas.  As such our materials will all
be uploaded to http://semo.instructure.com.  We will not use moodle.  The
moodle course for this section simply contains a link to canvas.

Grades, assignments, and course materials will all be hosted on Canvas.

## Paperless Classroom
In order to help reduce the risk of COVID-19, we will be using only electronic
materials this semester.  All exams, quizzes, and assignments will be
electronically distributed and submitted through Canvas.

# Policies
## Classroom Guideline of Minimizing the Risk of COVID-19
- Practice social distancing (six feet of spacing), wear facial coverings, and
  follow proper prevention hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and
  using alcohol-based (at least 60% alcohol) hand sanitizer when soap and water
  are not available. 

- The wearing of a face covering is a *University* safety requirement under the
  current conditions *as well as a Cape Girardeau County Emergency Order
  pursuant to RSMo 192.300*. We hope that through modeling and a positive and
  encouraging environment, all will do their part. If a student refuses to wear a
  face covering, it would be handled in the same manner as if they refused to
  comply with a course requirement or adhere to the Code of Student Conduct. An
  instructor may ask a student to leave a class and an employee may ask a person
  to leave a meeting or event if they do not wish to comply with the Face
  Coverings and Social Distance Guidelines.

  - In the event that a student does not comply with this guidance and does not
    leave the space, faculty/staff should send the student's name and email
    address or Southeast ID to deanofstudents@semo.edu. If a student refuses to
    leave a classroom or other University facility upon request, **and/or becomes
    disruptive**, the Department of Public Safety can be contacted for assistance.

  - **If you are not able to wear face coverings due to health or ADA concerns,
    contact the office of Disability Services at ds@semo.edu or 573-651-5927
    for information on how to obtain an exemption.  Affected individuals should
    also consult with their physicians before wearing a face covering.**

- Avoid sharing electronic devices, books, pens, and other learning aids unless
  thoroughly cleaned between users.

- Students are encouraged to clean and disinfect before and after class, any
  contact surfaces such as chairs, desks, and equipment utilized for the class.
  Students will follow the prototocol established for the classroom.

- Appropriate signage will be displayed in the classroom or adjacent areas on
  protocols to follow that protect our community members during classes.
  Please become familiar with this information and follow it in our shared
  community. 

- The seating in your classroom may be positioned to maintain social distancing
  or signs may be posted with seating direction. Do not move seating or signs
  unless instructed to do so by your instructor.  

- Social Distancing minimizes risk. When in buildings, hallways and entering or
  exiting buildings or classrooms, maintain at least six feet of social
  distancing space and avoid gathering in groups. 

- The week of instruction following Thanksgiving will be delivered completely
  online. Expectations and any work required are outlined in this syllabus.  

- The final exam will be online, and instructions are provided in the final
  exam section of the syllabus. 

## Academic Honesty 
Southeast Missouri State University expects all students, faculty and staff to
operate in an honest and ethical manner. Academic dishonesty is a very serious
offense because it undermines the value of your education and the education of
others. Students who engage in academic dishonesty face significant penalties.
Forms of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism,
cheating, contract cheating, misrepresentation, and other actions you take.
Some of these are defined below:

- Plagiarism means passing off someone else's work as your own, whether it is
  intentional or unintentional.
- Cheating includes copying from another person or source of information to
  meet the requirements of a task. 
- Contract cheating is paying someone else or a company to do your work. 
- Misrepresentation means you are posing as someone else or someone else is
  posing as you to complete a task. 
- Collusion means working with one or more people to cheat. If you help someone
  cheat or plagiarize you will face the same penalties.

http://www.semo.edu/responsibleredhawks/code-of-conduct.html or the Faculty
Handbook Section (D) on Academic Honesty

## Accessibility 
Southeast Missouri State University and Disability Services are committed to
making every reasonable educational accommodation for students who identify as
people with disabilities. Many services and accommodations which aid a
student’s educational experience are available for students with various
disabilities. Students are responsible for contacting Disability Services to
register and access accommodations. Accommodations are implemented on a case by
case basis. For more information, visit http://www.semo.edu/ds/ or contact
Disability Services at 573-651-5927.

## Civility 
Your university experience is purposely designed to introduce you to new ideas,
help you think effectively, develop good communication skills, evaluate
information successfully, distinguish among values and make sound judgements.
Doing this well requires respectful and courteous discussion among and between
students and the instructor. Together, we must create a space where we
acknowledge and respect others have different experiences, perspectives and
points of view. Disagreements are likely. Mutual respect for one another and a
willingness to listen are important. Remember, you are responsible for your
behavior and actions. There is a no tolerance policy on bullying or harassment
of any kind. Additional information on student conduct may be found at:
http://www.semo.edu/pdf/stuconduct-code-conduct.pdf?ver=1.0 and http://www.semo.edu/pdf/Conduct_Faculty_Resource_Guide.pdf  

## Mandatory Reporting 
I will keep information you share with me confidential to the best of my
ability, but as a professor I am legally required to share information about
sexual misconduct and crimes I learn about to make our campus and community
safe for everyone. 

## Student Success 
This course uses SupportNET, Southeast's student success network, to improve
communication between students, faculty and staff on campus. You’ll get emails
through SupportNET with information about resources or concerns. Please read
these emails—they are sent to help you succeed! You can access SupportNET
through your portal, Moodle or directly at https://supportnet.semo.edu to see any
academic alerts, ask for help and to access resources to support your success
at Southeast.
